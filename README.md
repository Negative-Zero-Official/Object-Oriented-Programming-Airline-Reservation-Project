## Overview

This project is a Java-based airline reservation system that demonstrates key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It provides functionality for booking, canceling, and viewing flights, managing customer data, and checking seat availability within a command-line interface.

## Features

- **Flight Management**: Add, remove, and view flight details.
- **Booking System**: Reserve and cancel seats on flights.
- **Customer Management**: Store and manage customer information.
- **Seat Availability**: Check available seats in each flight.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Uses classes like `Flight`, `Reservation`, and `Customer` for modular, organized code.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code (but any Java IDE should work perfectly fine)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Negative-Zero-Official/Object-Oriented-Programming-Airline-Reservation-Project.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the code.

## Usage

1. **Running the Program**:
   - Launch the program through your Java IDE or the command line after compiling.
